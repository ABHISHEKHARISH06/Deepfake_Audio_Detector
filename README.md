# Deepfake Audio Detector

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting **audio deepfakes** — synthetic voices generated by advanced AI models that threaten security, trust, and authentication systems. We compare **classical machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches for reliable detection in real-world conditions.

## 🚀 Methods
We employ three complementary detection strategies:

1. **MFCC + SVM**  
   - Extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).  
   - Classify with Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
   - ✅ Lightweight, computationally efficient.

2. **CQCC + GMM**  
   - Extract Constant-Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCCs).  
   - Classify using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with log-likelihood ratios.  
   - ✅ Robust, inherits strengths from traditional anti-spoofing.

3. **CNN + Mel-Spectrograms**  
   - Convert audio into Mel-spectrograms.  
   - Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for end-to-end learning.  
   - ✅ State-of-the-art accuracy.

## 📊 Results
- **CNN**: Achieves highest accuracy on the *In-the-Wild* dataset.  
- **SVM**: Offers speed and low resource usage.  
- **CQCC-GMM**: Provides robustness against varied spoofing conditions.  

👉 Together, these approaches illustrate the **trade-off between classical ML and deep learning** in audio deepfake detection.

▶️ To Run the Code
Activate the virtual environment and launch the Streamlit app:

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run detector.py

On Windows:

python3 -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run detector.py

This will start the audio deepfake detection interface in your browser. If it doesn’t open automatically, Streamlit will provide a local URL you can click.
